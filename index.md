I'm a software developer in the dotnet environment (primarily c#, interested f# and functional programming) with lots and lots of different interests and an avid member of the holy church of useless knowledge and can vanish for hours (ok, let's be honest, for days) in a wikipedia rabbit hole.

This is my dumpsite for all things interesting I do not want to forget.
